 * This annotation made explicit elements that are strongly coupled to MongoDB
 * 
 * <strong>Warning</strong>: In an ideal world, nothing should rely on the DB
 * directly! These links are mainly used to exploit the JSON capabilities of 
 * the MongoDB library, and to avoid intermediate transformation like 
 * Object -> JSON -> MongoDB. We know that it is an ugly hack, but we don't 
 * have time to make it better right now. Sorry for the inconvenience.
